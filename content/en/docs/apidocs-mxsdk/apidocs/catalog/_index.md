## APIs for the Catalog

Mendix offers the following APIs for the [Catalog](/catalog/): 

* [Search API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/search-api/)
  
  Search and retrieve information on registered assets that can be used in your app development.

* [Registration API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/registration-api/)
  
  Register and update services to the organization's Catalog.

* [Transform API](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/registration-api/#transform-api)
  
  For Mendix users deploying to a non-Mendix environment, generate the request bodies to register data sources published from your Mendix app. The v5 compatibility for the Transform API is accessible via the Registration API in the Endpoints section.
