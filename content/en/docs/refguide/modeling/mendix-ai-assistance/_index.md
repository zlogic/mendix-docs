## Introduction 

Mendix AI Assistance (Maia) refers to Mendix Platform capabilities that leverage [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.mendix.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence-ai/) and [machine learning (ML)](https://www.mendix.com/glossary/machine-learning/) to assist developers in application development (via AI-assisted development (AIAD)). Maia is designed to help development teams in modeling and delivering Mendix applications faster, more consistently, and with higher quality. 

Mendix developers can use Maia to get guidance by asking questions, get recommendation and assistance for certain development tasks, and even generate part of their app.

## Maia Capabilities in Mendix Studio Pro 

In addition to Maia Chat, Maia in Mendix Studio Pro has the following capabilities: 

Guidance:

* **Maia Chat** (generally available in Studio Pro 10.12.0 and the Mendix Portal) – a built-in chat interface powered by Generative AI in Studio Pro. It answers questions about app development in Mendix, including how to apply concepts, best practices, and development patterns. For more information, see [Maia Chat](/refguide/maia-chat/). 
* **Maia Learn** (available in Studio Pro 10.18 and above) - helps you to quickly learn Mendix core concepts and get started with Studio Pro. For more information, see [Maia Learn](/refguide/maia-learn/).

Recommenders:

* **Best Practice Recommender** – helps you inspect your app against Mendix development best practice detecting and pinpointing development anti-patterns and, in some cases, automatically fixing them. For more information, see [Best Practice Recommender](/refguide/best-practice-recommender/).
* **Logic Recommender** – helps you model and configure microflows, nanoflows, and rules in Mendix Studio Pro. It gives you contextualized recommendations on the next best activity based on the activities and parameters that are already configured in your application. For more information, see [Logic Recommender](/refguide/logic-recommender/).
* **UI Recommender** (available in Studio Pro 10.18 and above) – helps you easily add new widgets to a page in Mendix Studio Pro without losing the context of what you are currently working on. For more information, see [UI Recommender](/refguide/ui-recommender/).
* **Workflow Recommender** (available in Studio Pro 10.12 and above) – helps you model and configure workflows in Mendix Studio Pro. It gives you contextualized recommendations on the next best activity in your workflow based on context-related information. For more information, see [Workflow Recommender](/refguide/workflow-recommender/).

Generators:

* **Domain Model Generator** (currently an [experimental feature](/releasenotes/beta-features/) introduced in Studio Pro 10.13.0) - an AI-powered tool that you can use for generating a [domain model](/refguide/domain-model/). It helps you to generate entities and associations based on text input. It currently only works for empty domain models. For more information, see [Domain Model Generator](/refguide/domain-model-generator/).
* **Translation Generator** (currently an [experimental feature](/releasenotes/beta-features/) introduced in Studio Pro 10.12.0) - an AI-powered translation tool available in Mendix Studio Pro. Currently, it can be used for [batch translate](/refguide/translation-generator/#batch-translate) and [translating system texts](/refguide/translation-generator/#translate-system-text) in the new web-based system texts editor (in Studio Pro 10.14.0 and above). For more information, see [Translation Generator](/refguide/translation-generator/).
