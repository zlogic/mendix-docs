## Introduction

Use view entities to create apps that provide translations to your users.

For this purpose of this use case, the following domain model is used:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/multilingual-apps/domain-model.png" >}}

The entity *ProductTranslation* contains a translation of a product’s description to a language indicated by *LanguageCode*. *LanguageCode* is a standard 5-letter language-country code (such as `en_US`, `nl_NL`, `ko_KR`).

The descriptions in the default language (in this example, `en_US`) are stored in the *Product* entity, whereas translated descriptions (`nl_NL` and `ko_KR`) are stored in *ProductTranslation*. 

## Create an Overview Page

To use a view entity that translate languages, ensure that your app supports multiple languages. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open your **App Settings** and click the **Languages** tab.
2. Click **Add** and use the drop-down to select the languages you want to include in your app.
3. Click **OK** > **OK**.

Combine the languages in the two entities into a single view. To do this, join the *Product* and *ProductTranslation* tables by creating a new view entity.

1. Open your domain model and add a new view entity named *AllProductTranslationVE*.
2. Add the following query for your entity:

```
SELECT
    p.ProductId as ProductId,
    p.ProductName as ProductName,
    p.QuantityPerUnit as QuantityPerUnit,
    p.Discontinued as Discontinued,
    pt.LanguageCode as LanguageCode,
    coalesce(pt.Description, p.Description) as Description
FROM Shop.Product p
    JOIN p/Shop.ProductTranslation_Product/Shop.ProductTranslation pt
UNION
SELECT
    p.ProductId as ProductId,
    p.ProductName as ProductName,
    p.QuantityPerUnit as QuantityPerUnit,
    p.Discontinued as Discontinued,
    cast('en_US' as STRING) as LanguageCode,
    p.Description as Description
FROM Shop.Product p
```
{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/multilingual-apps/all-product-translation-ve.png" width="200" >}}

3. Filter the translation that corresponds to the user’s current language by creating a new view entity. Name this new entity *TranslatedProductVE*.
4. Add the query below to your entity:

```
SELECT
    pt.ProductId as ProductId,
    pt.ProductName as ProductName,
    pt.QuantityPerUnit as QuantityPerUnit,
    pt.Discontinued as Discontinued,
    pt.LanguageCode as LanguageCode,
    pt.Description as Description
FROM Shop.AllProductTranslationVE pt
    LEFT JOIN System.User as u on (u.ID = '[%CurrentUser%]')
    LEFT JOIN u/System.User_Language/System.Language as l
WHERE (l.Code = pt.LanguageCode)
```

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/multilingual-apps/translated-product-ve.png" width="200" >}}

Alternatively, you could also combine the  view entities into one with a nested query:

```
SELECT
  cp.ProductId as ProductId,
  cp.ProductName as ProductName,
  cp.QuantityPerUnit as QuantityPerUnit,
  cp.Discontinued as Discontinued,
  cp.Description as Description,
  cp.LanguageCode as LanguageCode
FROM
(
  SELECT
    p.ProductId as ProductId,
    p.ProductName as ProductName,
    p.QuantityPerUnit as QuantityPerUnit,
    p.Discontinued as Discontinued,
    pt.LanguageCode as LanguageCode,
    coalesce(pt.Description, p.Description) as Description
  FROM Shop.Product p
    JOIN p/Shop.ProductTranslation_Product/Shop.ProductTranslation pt
  UNION
  SELECT
    p.ProductId as ProductId,
    p.ProductName as ProductName,
    p.QuantityPerUnit as QuantityPerUnit,
    p.Discontinued as Discontinued,
    cast('en_US' as STRING) as LanguageCode,
    p.Description as Description
  FROM Shop.Product p
) as cp
  LEFT JOIN System.User as u on (u.ID = '[%CurrentUser%]')
  LEFT JOIN u/System.User_Language/System.Language as l
WHERE (l.Code = cp.LanguageCode)
```

5. Generate an overview page for the view entity by right-clicking *TranslatedProductVE* > **Generate overview pages**. 
6. Open the new page and remove the columns you do not need from the data grid.
7. Run your app locally. You should see the product description in the language that corresponds to the user’s current language.
