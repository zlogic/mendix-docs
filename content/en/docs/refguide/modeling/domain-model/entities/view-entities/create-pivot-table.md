## Introduction

Use a view entity to create a pivot table. A pivot table is a table that contains a summary of another, more extensive table.

## Use Case

For this purpose of this use case, the following domain model is used:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/domain-model/view-entities/pivot-table-view-entities/domain-model.png" >}}

In this example, you run a business and this is your shop's domain model. It includes:

* A *Product* entity that stores information of all the products sold
* An *Order* entity, which holds information about individual orders
* An *OrderLine* entity, which is a single item in an order

You want to analyze seasonal sales volumes, which is how much your business makes from sales in each quarter per year. You want your table to resemble the following:

| Year | TotalSales_Q1 | TotalSales_Q2 | TotalSales_Q3 | TotalSales_Q4| 
|------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1996 | $ …           | $ …           |  $ …          |  $ …          |   
| 1997 | $ …           | $ …           |  $ …          |  $ …          | 
| 1998 | $ …           | $ …           |  $ …          |  $ …          | 
| ...  | …             | …             |  …            |  …            |

## Create a Pivot Table

Create a view entity that shows each order together with its total value, calculated from the *OrderLine* entity. To do this, follow the steps below:

1. Open your domain model and add a new view entity. Name this entity *OrderVE*.
2. Add the following query to the OQL editor:

    ```sql
    SELECT
      o.OrderId as OrderId
      , CAST(DATEPART(QUARTER, o.OrderDate) as INTEGER) as OrderQuarter
      , CAST(DATEPART(YEAR, o.OrderDate) as INTEGER) as OrderYear
      , o.RequiredDate as RequiredDate
      , o.ShippedDate as ShippedDate
      , SUM(ol.UnitPrice * ol.Quantity * (1 - ol.Discount)) as TotalOrderValue
      , SUM(ol.Quantity) as TotalProductCount
      , COUNT(*) as UniqueProductCount
    FROM Shop."Order" as o
      JOIN o/Shop.OrderLine_Order/Shop.OrderLine as ol
    GROUP BY o.OrderId, o.OrderDate, o.RequiredDate, o.ShippedDate
    ```

{{% alert color="info" %}}

With view entities, you can take the relevant component of `DateTime` as a column using the `DATEPART` function. For more information, see the [`DATEPART` and `DATEDIFF`](/refguide/oql-v2/#date-validations) section of *OQL Version 2 Features*.

{{% /alert %}}

3. Add another view entity to the domain model and name it *OrderQuarterlyPivotVE*. This entity will show a table, similar to the format above.
4. Add the following query to the OQL editor:

    ```sql
    SELECT
        o.OrderYear as OrderYear,
        SUM(CASE WHEN o.OrderQuarter = 1 THEN o.TotalOrderValue ELSE 0 END) as TotalSales_Q1,
        SUM(CASE WHEN o.OrderQuarter = 2 THEN o.TotalOrderValue ELSE 0 END) as TotalSales_Q2,
        SUM(CASE WHEN o.OrderQuarter = 3 THEN o.TotalOrderValue ELSE 0 END) as TotalSales_Q3,
        SUM(CASE WHEN o.OrderQuarter = 4 THEN o.TotalOrderValue ELSE 0 END) as TotalSales_Q4
    FROM Shop.OrderVE o
    GROUP BY o.OrderYear
    ```

5. Click **Run Query** to preview the data.

6. Click **OK** to save. 
7. Create a page that shows the pivot table by right-clicking the new entity > **Generate overview pages**.
