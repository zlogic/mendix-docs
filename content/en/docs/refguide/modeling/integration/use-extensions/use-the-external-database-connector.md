## Introduction

Use the [External Database Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/219862) to connect, retrieve, and insert data into your Mendix app.

{{% alert color="info" %}}
If you are using Studio Pro 10.12, make sure to use the latest version 3.0.0 [External Database Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/219862).
{{% /alert %}}

The External Database Connector supports connections to the following databases:

* MSSQL
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Oracle
* Snowflake (GA support from [Studio Pro 10.12](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.12/) – Beta versions are available from [Studio Pro 10.10](/releasenotes/studio-pro/10.10/))

This document teaches you how to do the following:

* Connect your Mendix App to an external database
* Create and validate SQL queries
* Use created queries in the **Query External Database** activity

For information on how to configure the connector, see [External Database Connector](/appstore/modules/external-database-connector/). For information on the database wizard and how to connect using the External Database Connection document, see [External Database Connection](/refguide/external-database-connection/). 

## Prerequisites

Download the [External Database Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/219862) into your app. Make sure you have the following details for your external connection:  

* Username
* Password
* Host
* Port
* Database name

If additional connection properties are required to connect, you can alternatively use **JDBC Connection String**.

### Prerequisites from Studio Pro 10.19  (available for Studio Pro 10.18 Using the Flag: `--enable-live-preview`) {#enable-live-preview}


* Download the latest [External Database Connector](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/219862).
* If certificate-based authentication is required for PostgreSQL connections, ensure that all necessary certificates are added before running the app.
* To test the connection and execute queries during design time, Ensure to run your app locally.

 This functionality enhances consistency between design-time and runtime environments.

## Connect to the External Database

### Establish Connection Between the External Database and Mendix App

1. Right-click the module you want to add the external database document to and click **Add other** > **External database connection**.

2. Select the database you want to connect to and add the connection details in the Database Connection wizard.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/1.png" width="600" >}}

3. Click **“Test Connection”** to validate the connection to the external database.

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/2.png" width="600" >}}

Click **Save** to save the connection details, which are stored in 3 constants:

* `\<Document Name\>_DBSource`
* `\<Document Name\>_DBUsername`
* `\<Document Name\>_DBPassword`

For example: `*Database*_DBsource.`

{{% alert color="info" %}} Values for these constants are stored in the active configuration of the user. The password is stored as a private value.

Constants are an environment variable whose values can differ per environment, When you deploy an app on Mendix Cloud, values for constants are not added. For more information, see [Constants](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/configuration/#constants){{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
For free apps, make sure to add the default values to the constant in Studio Pro. For more information, see the [Deploying a Free App](https://docs.mendix.com/developerportal/deploy/mendix-cloud-deploy/deploying-an-app/#deploy-free-app) section below. {{% /alert %}}

### Explore Schemas of a Connected Database

When the connection is successful and saved, you can search the **Browse database** tab for Tables, Views, Procedures, and Functions.

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/3.png" width="700" >}}

### Create and Validate SQL Queries with Parameters

1. Create a new query by entering an SQL query in the **SQL query** field.

2. Open the **Parameters** tab and click **Add Parameter** if you want to use constants or variables in your query during runtime. Use curly braces to include a parameter in the query. 

3. Assign a Test Value to each parameter.

4. Click **Run Query** to validate the query and view the response.

For example, the query below retrieves a list of RequestedProductRequirement where the ProductLine is **Planes**.

SQL Query:
`Select requestedProductRequirement from productlines where productLine = {productLine}`

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/4.png" width="700" >}}

### Typecast Parameter Data Type

You can typecast `String` into UUID, as shown below:

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/13.png" width="700" >}}

## Save Query

### Save Query to Retrieve Data

1. Click **Use Response** to view the response data and mapping.

2. In the **Response Structure** tab, you can choose **New Entity** or **Reuse Entity**.

   a. If **New Entity** is selected, you can view the entity in the **Response structure** tab. Click **Save Query & Create Entity** to save the query and the newly created entity in the domain model. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/5.png" width="600" >}}

   b. If **Reuse Entity** is selected, all entities mapped to other queries of same document are listed in the drop-down list. Select the entity you want to reuse and click **Save Query**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/5a.png" width="600" >}}

### Save DML Query

1. For DML queries, *Number of affected rows* will be displayed as a response.

    For example, `INSERT INTO classicmodels.productlines(productLine, requestedProductRequirement)VALUES({productLine}, {requestedProductRequirement})`

2. Click **Save Query**.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/6.png" width="600" >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}} For all DML Queries, changes made to database in the Mendix Design phase are automatically rolled back. {{% /alert %}}

## Update Existing Query

You can use the existing entity when updating a existing query. 

{{% alert color="info" %}}

This feature was introduced in Studio Pro 10.15 and above.

{{% /alert %}}

For example, you can modify the query below to retrieve a list of `productLine`, `textDescription`, and `htmlDescription` columns from `productLines` where the `productLine` is **Planes**.

SQL Query:
Existing Query: `Select requestedProductRequirement from productlines where productLine = {productLine}`
Modified Query: `Select productLine, textDescription, htmlDescription from productlines where productLine = {productLine}`

Do the following:

1. Rerun the query to see the **Response data**.

2. Click **Use Response** to see the entity preview.

3. Use the existing entity or create a new entity.

   a. If **New Entity** is selected, you can view the entity in the **Response structure** tab. Click **Save Query & Create Entity** to save the query and the newly created entity in the domain model.

   b. If **Update Entity** is selected, you can see changes that will be made to the existing entity. Click **Update Entity** to save the query and the changes made to the entity in the domain model.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/5b.png" width="600" >}}

## Call Stored Procedure

{{% alert color="info" %}} Calling stored procedures with parameters is supported for Studio Pro 10.13 and above. {{% /alert %}}

To call a stored procedure, do the following:

1. Select the **Stored procedure** checkbox.

2. Enter the query to call a stored procedure. Add a schema name with the stored procedure name. For example, use the following syntax, where `latest_schema` is the schema name, and `InsertDataIntoTable1` is the stored procedure: `Call latest_schema.InsertDataIntoTable1({1},{2})`. 

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/9.png" width="600" >}}

3. Create **IN**, **OUT**, and **INOUT** parameters for all parameters present in the stored procedure. Make sure the **Name in DB** is the same as the name of parameter in the stored procedure.
   
    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/10.png" width="600" >}}

4. Click **Run Query**. This returns an entity with the number of affected rows and all INOUT and OUT parameters. If the stored procedure returns a **Result set**, an associated entity is created.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/11.png" width="600"  >}}

5. Click **Use Response** > **Save Query & Create Entity** to save the query and the newly-created entities in the domain model.
   
    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/12.png" width="600"  >}}

{{% alert color="info" %}}DML commands within a stored procedure are rolled back if they are not committed by a stored procedure, but DDL commands are not.{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert color="info" %}} Only stored procedures with primitive datatype parameters are supported.{{% /alert %}}

For Postgres, Mendix supports the following parameters:

* Decimal/numeric
* Real
* Double Precision
* Big Serial
* Small Serial
* Serial
* Bpchar
* Char
* Varchar
* Text
* Integer
* Smallint
* Bigint
* Timestamp with timezone
* Date only
* Time without timezone
* Time with timezone

For MSSQL, for **INOUT** and **OUT** parameters of type Decimal, test values (in design time) are rounded off. 

## Use the Query External Database Activity

1. Add the **Query external database** activity into your microflow.

2. Double-click on the activity and select the new external database document.

3. In the **Query** field, select the required query from the drop-down.

4. Assign values to the parameters using the **Expression editor**.

5. Output details for the selected query auto-populate.

    {{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/modeling/integration/use-the-external-database-connector/7.png" width="600"  >}}

You are now ready to use data from an external database in your Mendix App.

{{% alert color="warning" %}}
Make sure to use secure measures, as this action can allow for SQL injection into your app. Do not use user-supplied or environment-supplied variables in your SQL statement; if possible, they should be static.
