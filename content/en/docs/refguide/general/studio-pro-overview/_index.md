## Introduction

Mendix Studio Pro is a tool for creating, viewing, and editing your Mendix applications.

One Studio Pro instance can have only one app open at a time, but you can open two Studio Pro instances when necessary.

## Top Bar {#top-bar}

The Studio Pro top bar contains the following items:

* [Menus](#menus) 
* [Buttons to run and view your app](#run-and-view)
* [Links to the Mendix Portal and Marketplace](#links) 

### Menus {#menus}

In the Studio Pro top bar, you can see several menus, such as [Edit](/refguide/edit-menu/), [View](/refguide/view-menu/), and [Version Control](/refguide/version-control-menu/). Each menu contains items that allow you to perform various actions, such as to [create a deployment package](/refguide/create-deployment-package-dialog/), set [preferences](/refguide/preferences-dialog/), or view the [**Errors**](/refguide/errors-pane/) pane. 

For more information, see [Menus](/refguide/menus/). 

### Run and View App {#run-and-view}

Deploy your app by clicking the **Publish** or **Run Locally** ({{% icon name="controls-play" %}}) buttons. To view your deployed app, click **View App**. 

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/studio-pro-overview/view-and-publish.png" alt="View and Publish buttons" class="no-border" >}}

For more information on deployment in Mendix, see [Deploying Apps](/deployment/).

For more information on deploying and versioning your app, see the [Versioning an App Deployed to the Cloud](/refguide/using-version-control-in-studio-pro/#versioning-app) section in *Using Version Control in Studio Pro*. 

### Links and User Profile Menu {#links}

You can find links to the [Mendix Portal](/developerportal/) and [Marketplace](/appstore/) in the upper-right corner of Studio Pro.

Your profile picture is displayed next to these links if you are signed in. When you click the profile picture, the drop-down menu is displays your full name and email, a link to your user profile, and the **Sign Out** option. 

## App Explorer

An app consists of individual files (also known as documents) and settings that are grouped in folders and [modules](/refguide/modules/). The complete structure of your app can be viewed in the [App Explorer](/refguide/app-explorer/).

## Workspace {#working-area}

A workspace is a current document tab that you work in. The working area and its settings differs depending on the editor (for example, pages, microflows, domain model editors) and the type of document. 

### Document Tabs {#documents}

{{% alert color="info" %}}
This section describes documents in the working area, not panes that you can open and position around the working area. For more information on pane behavior, see the [Layout of Panes](/refguide/view-menu/#layout-of-panes) section in *View Menu*.
{{% /alert %}}

The documents you view and edit are shown in tabs. 

You can have multiple tabs open, similar to a modern web browser. These tabs can be closed, reordered, and shown side-by-side. 

Each document has its own save state, history, and future, so undo and redo actions are unlimited.

## Dockable Panes {#panes}

Dockable panes can be positioned around the working area and contain various elements and settings.

{{< figure src="/attachments/refguide/studio-pro-overview/pane-example.png" alt="Properties Pane Example" width="300" class="no-border" >}}

For example, you can view the [list of errors](/refguide/errors-pane/), run the [Best Practice Recommender](/refguide/best-practice-recommender/), configure properties of a specific document or an element, or view the toolbox. For more information on panes and their layout, see [View Menu](/refguide/view-menu/).

## Status Bar {#status-bar}

At the bottom-right of the Studio Pro main window pane is a status bar.

On the right is the version control buttons (branch status, incoming commits, outgoing commits). You can use these buttons to open the **Branch Line Manager**, as well as your commit history. For more information, see [Version Control](/refguide/version-control/).

On the right is the currently selected language. If you have set up multiple languages in your app, you can use the drop-down to change the language you are currently using. For more information, see [Language Menu](/refguide/translatable-texts/).
