## 11.0.2 {#1002}

**Release date: January 13, 2025**

### Fixes

* We have resolved an issue where remote JavaScript debugging failed in a custom-built Mendix Native Developer App, leading to crashes when enabling “Remote JS Debugging.” The problem was caused by Firebase services not being initialized properly during the build process. We have ensured that Firebase dependencies are now only included when explicitly required by the application.

## 11.0.1 {#1001}

**Release date: January 7, 2025**

### Fixes

* We have updated the AppCenter's Xcode version to 15.4.
* We added a parameter to Xcode configs to fix Bundle Identifier issues.

## 11.0.0 {#1000}

**Release date: December 17, 2024**

### Breaking Changes

#### JSC and Hermes Support {#jsc-hermes}

* We disabled JavaScriptCore(JSC) entirely and now only support Hermes.

#### Important Notes

* Apps created in Studio Pro 10.18 and above will automatically use Hermes without any additional configuration.
* For projects upgrading to 10.18 and above, follow the steps in [Upgrade Instructions](#upgrade-instructions) to migrate your app.
* Even if your project is already using Hermes, the update is still required.
