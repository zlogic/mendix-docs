## Introduction

Your  organization can place bulk orders to purchase Mendix certification exam seats. When Mendix processes the order, an exam admin is designated per order. 

Once the order is processed, the designated exam admin receives an email and notification to manage the order. The exam admin can oversee the details of the order and assign the purchased exam seats to individuals within the organization. People who are assigned exam seats will be granted free access to take the exam.

This how-to explains how you can manage exam seats as an exam admin.
